# Feedback-System-with-PHP


The Feedback System Project is a web-based application developed using PHP, XAMPP, MySQL, and JavaScript. It allows school or college faculty members to create and distribute feedback forms to students. Students can provide their feedback through these forms, and the collected feedback helps the administration make necessary improvements to the institution.


## How It Works

1. **Faculty Side**:
   - Faculty members log in to the system.
   - They create feedback forms with various questions.
   - The feedback forms are then shared with students.

2. **Student Side**:
   - Students log in to the system.
   - They fill out the feedback forms and submit their responses.

3. **Admin Side**:
   - The admin logs in to the system.
   - They can view all the feedback submitted by students.
   - The feedback data helps the admin make informed decisions for improvements.
